# Pacman Atari Game

# About
Recreated the famous Atari game, Pacman using Google Colab. This trains AI to play the game and it successfully gets better the more episodes it plays. I thought this was an interesting beginners project to AI.

Inspired by the Artificial Intelligence A-Z course on Udemy. However, I made my own changes to the project by attempting to make the AI smarter, capable of capturing more detailed information, and making better decisions based on what it learns from the data.
